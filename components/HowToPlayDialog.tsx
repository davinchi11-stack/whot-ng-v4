    <div className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground [&_b]:text-foreground">
      <h3 className={h3 + ' mt-0'}>The goal</h3>
      <p>Get rid of your cards, or finish a round holding the lowest total of card values. The host picks Rollover or Count.</p>
      <h3 className={h3}>Matching</h3>
      <p>Play a card with the <b>same shape or number</b> as the top card. Can’t, or don’t want to? Draw one card — your turn then ends.</p>
      <h3 className={h3}>Special cards</h3>
      <ul className="grid list-disc gap-1 pl-5">
        <li><b>1 · Hold On</b> — everyone else is skipped; you play again.</li>
        <li><b>2 · Pick 2</b> — next player picks 2 unless they defend with another 2.</li>
        <li><b>5 · Pick 3</b> — like Pick 2 but 3 cards (traditional). The host can change it to 5.</li>
        <li><b>8 · Suspension</b> — the next player misses a turn.</li>
        <li><b>14 · General Market</b> — every other player draws 1; you play again.</li>
        <li><b>Whot (20, the crown)</b> — plays on anything; call any shape. The next player must follow it or play another Whot.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className={h3}>Defence and stacking</h3>
      <p>With <b>defence on</b> you can answer a penalty with a permitted card. With <b>stacking on</b> the penalty adds up (2 + 2 = 4) until someone can’t defend. With stacking off a defence passes the same penalty on. With <b>defence off</b> you simply draw it.</p>
      <h3 className={h3}>Modes</h3>
      <p><b>Rollover:</b> the round ends when someone plays their last card. <b>Count:</b> the round ends when someone plays their last card <i>or</i> the market runs out.</p>
      <h3 className={h3}>The count</h3>
      <p>When a round ends, add up the <b>values of the cards left in your hand</b> — the number on each card, and Whot counts 20 (never the number of cards). Holding 2, 12 and a Whot makes 2 + 12 + 20 = 34. <b>The lowest total wins the round</b> and the <b>highest total</b> is last. There are no running points: the table just keeps a win tally like “Ada 1 – 0 Bola”. “Next round” keeps the tally; “New game” resets it.</p>
      <h3 className={h3}>Last card</h3>
      <p>When anyone is down to one card, their seat or hand glows red with a <b>LAST CARD</b> tag.</p>
      <h3 className={h3}>When the market runs out</h3>
      <p>Rollover: the played pile (except the top card) is reshuffled. Count: the round ends and everyone counts their hand.</p>
      <h3 className={h3}>First game in 30 seconds</h3>
